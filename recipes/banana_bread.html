        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Banana bread is a popular dessert that combines the natural sweetness of ripe bananas with the
        soft and fluffy texture of cake. It's a great way to use up ripe bananas that might otherwise
        go to waste and makes a delicious treat for any occasion. This is my favorite recipe as it is 
        easy to make and ingredients are almost always available. However, if you like, you could add 
        extra ingredients such as nuts, dried fruit and chocolate chunks. There are so many ways to make 
        banana cake.
