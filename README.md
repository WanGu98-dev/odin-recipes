# odin-recipes
My first project on The Odin Project: building a basic recipe website.

In this project, I built a basic recipe website containing recipes of some of my favorite foods.
Some skills I demonstrated in this project include using both unordered and ordered lists to 
write down the ingredients and steps required to prepare each dish. I also made use of headers and was
able to add images to my recipes. Thanks to the previous lessons in The Odin Project, I was able to build
this website with little trouble.
